# Group 17 - QuickReg

Welcome to group 17 software project 2019-2020, our project was to rpelace the current registration system at goldsmiths with the use of a 
QR scanning app, inside this project you'll find the various html pages, the QR scanner page as well as the QR generator page which we had to
improvise with and use open source work from guthub, however the original developers were credited and a link to their respective projects
have been added to each page as well as in the report.

This project displays our Front-end code for the QuickReg app developed by Darshan Singh (Project manager and lead developer for group 17)

We hope you enjoy taking a look at our hard work that was done over 8 weeks!

Darshan, Tristan, Amina and Hodo.
